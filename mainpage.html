		<p> I am currently a undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My minors are Mathematics and Informatics. I am interested in pursuing a career in software development.
However, I love broadening my horizons and would love to explore avenues like big data and cloud computing. 
I am meticulous and passionate about what I do. I am proficient in C and Java. This passion also reflects in my school work. I currently have a GPA of 4.0 on a scale of 4 and am a part of Honors College. I have a thirst for knowledge which fuels my motivation to learn as much as I have the opportunity to in my field.</p>
